You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.\n\nJekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:\n\n`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`\n\nWhere `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\n\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\n\n{% highlight ruby %}\ndef print_hi(name)\n puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\nend\nprint_hi('Tom')\n#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nCheck out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].\n\n[jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home\n[jekyll-gh]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll\n[jekyll-talk]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/",
