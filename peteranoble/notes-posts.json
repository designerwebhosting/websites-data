The printer will have a print area of about 350mm x 350mm (XY) and infinity for the Z axis.<!--more--> It will print at 45 degrees onto a heated conveyor belt allowing it to build long print in the Z axis. Similar 3D printer geometries have been built by Brook Drumm from Printrbot and Blackbelt.\n\nOver time I will update this post and post new posts about the build and the theory behind this style of 3D printer.\n\n**Update 2022-02-13** \n\nThis printer did not get completed and was abandoned in 2019. Although I was very happy with the structural design, it was difficult to identify suitable materials for the belt assembly. It is interesting that all the 3d printers of this simular printing method are showing ongoing issues with their belt mechanisms.\n\nSome of the ideas and lessons will be used on other 3dprinter designs.",

    "body": "[//]: # ([description: My experience using Google voice for Documents to create web content.])\n\nThis post was written using Google voice type, I hope to explain and demonstrate how using Voice type to create a post is easy.\n<!--more-->\n\n![google-voice.jpg](/assets/images/google-voice.jpg){:.w3-image style=\"width: 420px\"}\n\n How you could use voice type to generate your own posts or articles. The hardest thing to get use to is actually speaking out loud and trying to get your thoughts together to create the post. However over time this will become easier and you will become quicker at creating your documents.\n\nA word of warning I don't recommend using Google voice type creating documents when driving your car or operating machinery. Where I am unable to use Voice type, I just record my voice and play it back into my document using Voice type later. It takes a bit more editing but this way you can concentrate on what you are doing and not on editing.\n\n## How I use Google Voice type\n\nTo begin with I set out a list of headings as a framework to help me plan my post and to prompt me when speaking. For example :-\n\nIntroduction\n\noutline\n\nmain paragraph\n\ncall To Action\n\nOffer\n\nHow to contact\n\nsummary\n\nUnder each heading I add my content and build my document. When I have completed generating my content I edit and check the layout on my Chromebook before posting the document to my site. A quick post could be easily edited on an Android phone and posted to the website, but adding images and diagrams are often easier on my Chromebook.\n\n## Google Voice type punctuation\n\nPunctuation can be easily added to your text as you speak, but it does take a bit of getting use to.\n\n* > Period (.)\n\n* > comma (,)\n\n* > question mark (?)exclamation or exclamation point (!)\n > Line spacing: Enter or new line, new paragraph\n\n## Google Voice Typing with Google Documents.\n\nUsing Google voice typing within Google document is very easy, all you have to do is go to the tools menu and select Voice typing. Then move your cursor to where you want to place your text, click the microphone icon and start speaking.\n\n## Google Voice Typing with Your Android Phone\n\nTo use voice typing on a Google phone with Google Documents I had to install the Google keyboard app and set up the keyboard input settings. Now when I use Google Documents the keyboard has a little microphone, which when selected allows me to use Google Type Voice to create my document. Using voice type is very easy compared to trying to use the small little keyboard on my Android phone.",
